            <p>What can one say about something so amazing and awe inspiring such as Cyrus Ghadiri. Some call him a god
                amongst men, while others treat as a force of nature that blesses them with its presence. The blind can
                see, the crippled can walk, and the angels sing in joyous celebration in his presence. All we know is
                greatness has form, and its name is Cyrus Ghadiri.</p>
            <br>
            <p>He came into being in San Jose with roars of resounding joy. Most believed it to be the second coming,
                while others believing it to be the universe rewarding the Earth with something divine. Some believed it
                to be a sign of good fortune, and they were not wrong. Crop yeilds quintupled, crime became
                non-existent, natural distaters halted, the diseased were healed, and there was not a single belly that
                was empty.</p>
            <br>    
            <p>As Cyrus grew, so did the world. Technology skyrocketed, economies boomed, mortality rates fell, and
                poverty declined. The world was once an unforgiving and scary place for most and it turned into a
                paradise that welcomed all with a loving embrace. The world looked to Cyrus wishing to express their
                rapturous gratitude, but before they could speak they heard his voice say "You're Welcome". And now he's
                in a coding bootcamp</p>
